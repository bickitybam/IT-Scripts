# IT-Scripts
A collection of useful batch, vbs, &amp; PowerShell scripts for accomplishing various IT tasks


Most but not all scripts contain information on the original author. Others are a combination of several scripts published by others that I found online. I claim no ownership to any of these scripts. I will update references to the original authors in the script comments in the future.
